                As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the <br> study of celestial bodies by applying the laws
                of <br>
                physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of <br> different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular
                <br> physics,
                relativity, particle physics, etc. This book <br> unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics, <br>
                which will be
                crucial for the holistic understanding <br> of the subject matter.

                    Are we alone in the Universe? Was there anything <br> before the Big Bang? Are there other universes? <br> What
                makes stars shine? Where does Earth's water <br> come from? Why is the night sky dark? Was there <br> ever life on
                Mars? How do telescopes work? This <br> engaging guide book answers all these questions <br> and hundreds more.

                    This second edition of Introduction to Cosmology <br> is an exciting update of an award-winning <br> textbook. It
                explains modern cosmological <br> concepts, such as dark energy, in the context of the <br> Big Bang theory. Its
                clear, lucid writing style, with <br> a wealth of useful everyday analogies, makes it <br> exceptionally engaging.

                    Planetary research today is a strongly <br> multidisciplinary endeavor with efforts coming <br> from engineering
                    and natural sciences. This book <br> provides an up-to-date interdisciplinary geoscience- <br> focused overview of
                    solid solar system bodies and <br> their evolution, based on the comparative <br> description of processes acting
                    on them.

                    In writing this textbook the author's objective was <br> to provide students with a non-trivial, reasonably <br>
                    priced introduction to astronomy. Starting with <br> problems astronomers face on Earth connected with <br>
                    observation, the  book then moves on to cover the <br> Solar System, galaxies and finally cosmology.
